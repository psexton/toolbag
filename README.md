# toolbag
My scripts and other assorted dev tools

## Conventions

1. Don't use file extensions on scripts in `bin/`. E.g. `foobar` not `foobar.sh` or `foobar.py`. Less typing overrides proper naming in this case.
1. Use `#!/usr/bin/env NAME` as the shebang line. 
1. Shell scripts are written for bash, even though I use zsh as an interactive shell.
1. Python scripts can assume a "recent" version of python3.
